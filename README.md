# Notes.py Overview

The Notes.py application allows the user to take a markdown file and break it into different files based on tags, identified by the user. The application can also convert any markdown file into Microsoft Word (using pypandoc) or upload any markdown file to Notion (using notion and md2notion). The tags need to be manually added to the markdown file by the user. The Notes.py application has a utility for the user to add new tags to the application tag list.
